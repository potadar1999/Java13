Briefly explain the difference between Early and Late Binding with examples

the process of using the class information to resolve method calling that occurs at compile time is called Early Binding
the process of using the object to resolve method calling that occurs at run time is called Late Binding
Early Binding happens at compile time.
Late Binding happens at run time.
Early binding is know as Static Binding.
Late binding is know as Dynamic Binding.
Overriding method are bonded using early binding.
Overridden methods are bonded using late binding.

Example:

Class Student{
  void Name(){
  System.out.println("Names");
  }
  
  static void Classes(){
  System.out.println("Classes");
  }
}

class Marks extends Student{

@Override
	void Name() {
		System.out.println("Nam");
		
	}
	
	  static void Classes(){
  System.out.println("Varga");
  }


}



public class Main {
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Student S1=new Marks();
		Student.Name();
		Student.Classes();
		
	}

}
